    Proxy class for operations on libgravix2's `Planets`

    New planets are allocated and initialized at the provided coordinates. Planets can
    be accessed and removed by referring to them by their respective indices. Removing
    planets can rearrange the internal representation and indices associations might
    change. Use :fun:`gravix2.Planets.planet_id` to get a static and unique
    identification (ID) for each planet. Initially, indices are IDs are identically.

    Use :func:`gravix2.Gravix2.new_planets` to create a new instance.
